**Maximal Onset Principle (MOP)** (research line 1): consonants are preferably grouped at syllabic onset\n    - **Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP)** (research line 2): sonority increases at onset, peaks at nucleus, decreases in coda \n* Do newborns use MOP and SSP to detect syllable boundaries?\n* Are these mechanisms shared with non-human animals (Long-Evants rats)?\n\n::: {.notes}\n- We will investigate the potential role of the syllable as a biologically meaningful linguistic unit, whose perception is constrained, from birth, by two linguistic universals:\n- The Maximal Onset Principle (MOP) and the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP)\n- Both universals determine to a large extent the position of syllabic boundaries, and the order of the segments that make up a syllable\n- We will also investigate whether a non-human animal species (Long-Evans rats), which do not develop language, are also sensitive to any of these principles\n:::\n\n\n# Reswarch line : Maximal Onset Principle (MOP)\n\nNeonates and infants\n\n## Study 1: are newborns sensitive to (violations of) the MOP?\n\n::: box\nConsonants are preferably grouped at syllable onset.\n:::\n\n- MOP-compliant: CV.CCV (\"pe.klo\")  \n- MOP-noncompliant: CVC.CV (\"pok.lo\")\n\n::: {.notes}\n- The first universal we will investigate is the Maximal Onset Principle (MOP)\n- This principle states that \"consonants\" are preferably grouped at syllable onset\n- This priniple constrains the position of syllabic boundaries\n- If neonates are sensitive to violations of the MOP, it would suggest that they might be using the MOP to syllabify the speech signal from birth\n:::\n\n\n## Participants\n\n* ~50 healthy, hearing, full term neonates\n* ~50 healthy, hearing, full term 6-10 mo infant\n* Mostly Catalan and/or Spanish linguistic background\n\n::: {.notes}\n- We will run an experimental series that involves neonates and infants\n- Neonates will be tested using fNIRS, while infants will be tested using fNIRS and behavioural tasks (like the HeadTurn Preference Procedure)\n- I will focus on the fNIRS testing of neonates and infants, as they follow the same task design\n- IDeally, we'd like to test up to 50 participants per experiment, although power analysis is pending\n- Most of our participants will have a Catalan and/or Spanish background\n:::\n\n\n## fNIRS setup\n\n* NIRSport2 (NIRx), NIRScap\n* Sampling frequency 20.345 Hz (~0.05 s samples)\n* CW 760 nm & 850 nm\n* 8 channels LH, 8 channels RH\n* ROIs: L and R temporal regions\n* Crib testing in neonates, parents' lap in infants (watching cartoons)\n\n## Task design (fNIRS block design)\n\n1. **Familiarisation phase**:\n  -
