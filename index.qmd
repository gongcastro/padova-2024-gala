**Gates to Language (GALA) ERC project (Chiara Santolin)**
:::

::: {.notes}
- Most animals develop sophisticated communicative systems
- Only humans develop language (compositional, recursive, symbolic, etc.)
- Some animals show near-human-level abilities in some of those domains
- We share with non-human animals some mechanisms that support language
- Are those mechanisms the entry gate to human language acquisition?
- In this ERC-StG awareded to Chiara Santolin, we are going to investigate the possible role of two of those mechanisms on early language acquisition

## Syllable: a biologically meaningful linguistic unit?

* The linguistic signal is continuous, and must be **segmented** into relevant discrete units (e.g., phrases, words, syllables)
* Newborns (and adults) preferentially parse the speech signal into syllable-sized units [@bijeljac19934; @flo2022sleeping; @luo2007phase; @jusczyk1987representation; @bertoncini1988investigation]

::: {.notes}
- We are focusing on one of the first and most critical steps in language acquisition: chunking the consitnuous speech stream into discrete, linguistically relevant units.
- Syllables seem to be specially important during the first stages of language acquisition
- Newborns preferentially parse speech into syllables (as opposed to individual phonemes, words, or phrases)
- What makes syllables so special?

::: {.notes}
- The universal structure of a syllable is made of three elements
- A mandatory nucleus: this is a high-sonority speech sound (predominantly a vowel)
- Perhaps an onset, made of one or more consonants
- Perhaps a coda, made of one or more consonant

## Universal constraints to syllabic structure

Can you syllabify this word?

> /likla/

Which of these syllables sound good to you?

> /plick/ vs. /lpick/

::: {.notes}
- However, some constraints to syllabic structure seem to be universal
- Universal: most, if not all languages, show a preference for following some specific constraints
- The aim of this project is to investigate the possible role of these universals as an early mechanism for syllabification
:::


## Syllable: a biologically meaningful linguistic unit?

* Two linguistic universals constrain syllabic structure:
    - **Maximal Onset Principle (MOP)** (research line 1): consonants are preferably grouped at syllabic onset
    - **Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP)** (research line 2): sonority increases at onset, peaks at nucleus, decreases in coda 
* Do newborns use MOP and SSP to detect syllable boundaries?
* Are these mechanisms shared with non-human animals (Long-Evants rats)?

::: {.notes}
- We will investigate the potential role of the syllable as a biologically meaningful linguistic unit, whose perception is constrained, from birth, by two linguistic universals:
- The Maximal Onset Principle (MOP) and the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP)
- Both universals determine to a large extent the position of syllabic boundaries, and the order of the segments that make up a syllable
- We will also investigate whether a non-human animal species (Long-Evans rats), which do not develop language, are also sensitive to any of these principles
:::


# Reswarch line : Maximal Onset Principle (MOP)

Neonates and infants

## Study 1: are newborns sensitive to (violations of) the MOP?

::: box
Consonants are preferably grouped at syllable onset.
:::

- MOP-compliant: CV.CCV ("pe.klo")  
- MOP-noncompliant: CVC.CV ("pok.lo")

::: {.notes}
- The first universal we will investigate is the Maximal Onset Principle (MOP)
- This principle states that "consonants" are preferably grouped at syllable onset
- This priniple constrains the position of syllabic boundaries
- If neonates are sensitive to violations of the MOP, it would suggest that they might be using the MOP to syllabify the speech signal from birth
:::


## Participants

* ~50 healthy, hearing, full term neonates
* ~50 healthy, hearing, full term 6-10 mo infant
* Mostly Catalan and/or Spanish linguistic background

::: {.notes}
- We will run an experimental series that involves neonates and infants
- Neonates will be tested using fNIRS, while infants will be tested using fNIRS and behavioural tasks (like the HeadTurn Preference Procedure)
- I will focus on the fNIRS testing of neonates and infants, as they follow the same task design
- IDeally, we'd like to test up to 50 participants per experiment, although power analysis is pending
- Most of our participants will have a Catalan and/or Spanish background
:::


## fNIRS setup

* NIRSport2 (NIRx), NIRScap
* Sampling frequency 20.345 Hz (~0.05 s samples)
* CW 760 nm & 850 nm
* 8 channels LH, 8 channels RH
* ROIs: L and R temporal regions
* Crib testing in neonates, parents' lap in infants (watching cartoons)

## Task design (fNIRS block design)

1. **Familiarisation phase**:
  - 10 blocks of words (20-22s silence between blocks)
  - 6 words different words in each block (0.5-1.5s silence between words)
2. **Test phase**:
  - 8 blocks of artificially segmented words: 2 Non-alt/SSP+, 2 Non-alt/SSP-, 4 Alt (20-22s silence between blocks)
  - 12 words different words in each block (0.5-1.5s silence between words)

## Stimuli

::: box
**CVCCV words**: Onset + Consonant cluster (CC) + Vowel
:::

| Follows MOP (CV.CCV) | Violates MOP (CVC.CV)|
|-------------|--------------|
|pa.kla       |pak.la        |
|ro.tri       |rot.ri        |


## Stimuli

CV.CCV: 

- CC follows the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP)
- CC is phonotactical at onset in speakers' and participants' native language(s)

CVC.CV:

- C is allowed in coda in speakers' and participants' native language(s)

## Questions

- Natural speaker or synthesised speech (e.g., MBROLA)?
- Variability vs. repetition? More vs. less consonant clusters
- Linguistic experience at 8-12 months?
- Familiarisation phase: how many blocks is enough/too much?
- fNIRS recording during familiarisation? (e.g., capping in between phases)

# Research line 2: Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP)

Neonates, infants, Long-Evans rats

## Study 1: are newborns sensitive to (violations of) the MOP

Syllables are predominantly a production unit: they result from a "single effort or impulse of the voice" [@whitney1874oriental].

> In a syllable, sonority increases toward the peak and decreases toward the margins [@morelli2003relative].

Most animal vocalisations follow this sonority pattern -> Evolutionary relevance -> Ancentral, inherited mechanism for perception?
